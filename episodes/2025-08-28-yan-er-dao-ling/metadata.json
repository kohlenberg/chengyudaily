  "script": "Welcome to Chengyu Bites — your quick summary on Chinese 成语. Today, we explore a phrase that highlights the futility of self-deception. [break 1s] The phrase is: 掩耳盗铃, yǎn ěr dào líng. [break 0.5s] 掩 (yǎn) - to cover [break 0.5s] 耳 (ěr) - ear [break 0.5s] 盗 (dào) - to steal [break 0.5s] 铃 (líng) - bell [break 1s] So, 掩耳盗铃 literally means to cover one's ears while stealing a bell, which figuratively suggests ignoring reality or being willfully blind to the truth. [break 1s] Here’s the story behind it: [break 1.5s] Once, a thief wanted to steal a bell but knew it would make a loud noise. To avoid detection, he covered his ears while stealing it, thinking that if he couldn't hear the sound, no one else could either. This foolish act illustrates how some people ignore obvious truths in their own lives. [break 1.5s] Example 1: 他掩耳盗铃，不愿面对自己的错误。 [break 1s] He is ignoring his mistakes, thinking that if he doesn't acknowledge them, they don't exist. [break 1s] Example 2: 在这次会议上，他们掩耳盗铃，拒绝听取反对意见。 [break 1s] In this meeting, they ignored opposing views, refusing to listen to any dissent. [break 1s] Example 3: 掩耳盗铃并不能解决问题。 [break 1s] Covering your ears won't solve the problem. [break 1s] So, 掩耳盗铃 reminds us that ignoring reality doesn't change it. Thank you for listening to Chengyu Bites! See you next time for another idiom. [break 1s]"
