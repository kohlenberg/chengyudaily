  "script": "Welcome to Chengyu Bites — your quick summary on Chinese 成语. Today, we explore a phrase that highlights the futility of self-deception. [break 1s] The phrase is: 掩耳盗铃, yǎn ěr dào líng. [break 1s] Let's break it down: [break 0.5s] 掩 (yǎn) means 'to cover'. [break 0.5s] 耳 (ěr) means 'ear'. [break 0.5s] 盗 (dào) means 'to steal'. [break 0.5s] 铃 (líng) means 'bell'. [break 1s] So, the full idiom again: 掩耳盗铃, which literally means 'to cover one's ears while stealing a bell', and figuratively suggests that ignoring a problem doesn't solve it. [break 1s] Here’s the story behind it: [break 1.5s] A long time ago, a man wanted to steal a bell but knew it would make a loud noise. To avoid getting caught, he covered his ears, thinking that if he couldn't hear it, he wouldn't be discovered. However, this silly tactic only made it easier for others to catch him. [break 1.5s] Now, let's look at three examples: [break 1s] 他掩耳盗铃，不愿面对自己的错误。 [break 1s] He is covering his ears while stealing the bell, unwilling to face his mistakes. [break 1s] 她选择掩耳盗铃，不想听到别人对她的批评。 [break 1s] She chooses to cover her ears while stealing the bell, not wanting to hear others' criticisms of her. [break 1s] 这种行为就像掩耳盗铃，根本没有解决问题。 [break 1s] This behavior is just like covering one's ears while stealing a bell; it doesn't solve the problem at all. [break 1s] So, remember: 掩耳盗铃 means to ignore a problem, thinking it will go away. Thanks for listening to Chengyu Bites! See you next time for another idiom."
