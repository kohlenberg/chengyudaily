  "script": "Welcome to Chengyu Bites — your quick summary on Chinese 成语. Today, we're diving into a phrase that describes a common struggle: being torn between choices. [break 1s] The phrase is: 三心二意, sān xīn èr yì. [break 0.5s] 三 (sān) means 'three' [break 0.5s] 心 (xīn) means 'heart' [break 0.5s] 二 (èr) means 'two' [break 0.5s] 意 (yì) means 'intention' or 'mind.' [break 1s] So, the full idiom is 三心二意, which literally translates to 'three hearts and two intentions.' Figuratively, it describes someone who is indecisive or distracted. [break 1s] Here’s the story behind it: [break 1.5s] This idiom originates from an ancient tale where a man was so torn between two choices that he thought of three different outcomes. He could neither commit to one nor the other, hence he had 'three hearts and two intentions.' This reflects the struggle many face when making decisions, leading to confusion and inaction. [break 1.5s] Example one: 他做事总是三心二意。 [break 1s] He is always indecisive in his work. [break 1s] Example two: 你不能三心二意，选择一个方向。 [break 1s] You can't be indecisive; choose one direction. [break 1s] Example three: 她在感情上总是三心二意。 [break 1s] She is always indecisive in her relationships. [break 1s] So, that’s 三心二意, meaning indecisive or distracted. Thanks for listening to Chengyu Bites! See you next time for another idiom. [break 1s]"
