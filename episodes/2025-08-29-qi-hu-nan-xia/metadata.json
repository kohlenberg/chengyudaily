  "script": "Welcome to Chengyu Bites — your quick summary on Chinese 成语. Ever felt stuck in a situation where you can't easily back out? This idiom captures that feeling perfectly.[break 1s]The phrase is: 骑虎难下, qí hǔ nán xià.[break 0.5s]骑 (qí) means 'to ride'[break 0.5s]虎 (hǔ) means 'tiger'[break 0.5s]难 (nán) means 'difficult'[break 0.5s]下 (xià) means 'to get down' or 'to dismount'[break 1s]So, 骑虎难下 literally means 'hard to get down from a tiger' and figuratively refers to a situation that is hard to escape from once you're involved.[break 1s]Here’s the story behind it:[break 1.5s]This idiom comes from a tale about a warrior who rode a tiger during battle. At first, he felt powerful riding the fierce animal, but soon realized he couldn't safely dismount without facing danger. This reflects how sometimes, when we take bold actions, we may find ourselves in tricky predicaments that are hard to escape from.[break 1.5s]Example 1: 他已经投资了很多钱，现在骑虎难下。[break 1s]He has invested a lot of money, now it's hard for him to back out.[break 1s]Example 2: 她在这个项目中付出了太多，所以她觉得骑虎难下。[break 1s]She has invested too much in this project, so she feels it's hard to back out now.[break 1s]Example 3: 如果你不早点解决问题，骑虎难下的局面就会出现。[break 1s]If you don't solve the problem early, a difficult situation will arise where it's hard to get out.[break 1s]So, remember, 骑虎难下 means 'hard to dismount from a tiger,' reflecting the challenges of escaping tricky situations. Thanks for listening to Chengyu Bites! See you next time for another idiom.[break 1s]"
