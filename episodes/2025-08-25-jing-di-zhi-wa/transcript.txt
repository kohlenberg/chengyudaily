[break 1s] So, 井底之蛙 literally means 'frog at the bottom of the well'. Figuratively, it refers to someone with a limited perspective or narrow view of the world. [break 1s] Here’s the story behind it: [break 1.5s] Long ago, a frog lived at the bottom of a well and thought it was the entire world. One day, a turtle from the ocean came to visit and told the frog about the vastness of the sea. The frog couldn't comprehend it, believing its well was all there was.
