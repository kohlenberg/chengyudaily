  "script": "Welcome to Chengyu Bites — your quick summary on Chinese 成语. Ever found yourself in a situation where you realized you needed something only at the last minute? [break 1s] The phrase is: 临渴掘井, lín kě jué jǐng. [break 1s] 临 (lín) - to approach; [break 0.5s] 渴 (kě) - thirsty; [break 0.5s] 掘 (jué) - to dig; [break 0.5s] 井 (jǐng) - well. [break 1s] So, the full idiom is 临渴掘井, which literally means 'digging a well when thirsty' and figuratively suggests acting too late in a situation. [break 1s] Here’s the story behind it: [break 1.5s] This idiom originates from ancient China, where water sources were not always readily available. Imagine a traveler who, feeling parched, suddenly needs to find water and starts digging a well without preparing in advance. This scenario teaches us that we should plan ahead and not wait until the last moment to take action. [break 1.5s] Example one: 你临渴掘井，根本来不及了。 [break 1s] You are digging a well when you’re already thirsty; it’s too late. [break 1s] Example two: 他总是临渴掘井，从不提前准备。 [break 1s] He always waits until the last minute to prepare, never planning ahead. [break 1s] Example three: 临渴掘井的后果很严重。 [break 1s] The consequences of acting too late can be serious. [break 1s] So, the idiom 临渴掘井 reminds us to be proactive rather than reactive. Thanks for listening to Chengyu Bites! See you next time for another idiom. [break 1s]"
