Welcome to Chengyu Bites — your quick summary on Chinese 成语. Today, we explore how a small detail can make a big difference.  The phrase is: 画龙点睛, huà lóng diǎn jīng.  画 (huà) - to paint  龙 (lóng) - dragon  点 (diǎn) - to dot or to touch  睛 (jīng) - eye  So, 画龙点睛 literally means "to paint a dragon and dot its eyes," and figuratively, it means to add the finishing touch; to make something come alive.  Here’s the story behind it:  A famous painter once created a stunning dragon mural but left out the eyes. When asked why, he replied that without the eyes, the dragon wouldn’t come to life. After he added the eyes, it seemed to soar off the wall! This illustrates how important small details can be.  Example one: 这部电影的结尾画龙点睛。  The ending of this movie adds the finishing touch.  Example two: 他的演讲非常精彩，最后一句话画龙点睛。  His speech was amazing, and the last sentence was the finishing touch.  Example three: 这幅画需要一些细节来画龙点睛。  This painting needs some details to come alive.  So, remember, 画龙点睛 means to add the finishing touch; to make something come alive. Thank you for listening to Chengyu Bites! See you next time for another idiom.
