Ever wondered why seeing is believing? Let's dive into today's idiom!

## Overview
Hearing about something is not as good as seeing it yourself.

## Phrase
**耳闻不如一见** — ěr wén bù rú yī jiàn
## Characters


耳 (ěr) — ear  
闻 (wén) — to hear  
不 (bù) — not  
如 (rú) — as  
一 (yī) — one  
见 (jiàn) — to see


## Origin
The saying originates from a time when travelers would share stories about distant lands. While these tales were fascinating, they couldn’t match the impact of actually witnessing those places. Hence, it became clear that experiencing something yourself was far more valuable than just hearing about it.

## Examples

- 我听说这个地方很美，但耳闻不如一见。<br>I've heard this place is beautiful, but seeing it is much better.
