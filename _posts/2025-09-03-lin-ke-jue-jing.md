## Overview
Digging a well when thirsty; acting too late.

## Phrase
**临渴掘井** — lín kě jué jǐng
## Characters


临 (lín) — to approach  
渴 (kě) — thirsty  
掘 (jué) — to dig  
井 (jǐng) — well


## Origin
This idiom originates from ancient China, where water sources were not always readily available. Imagine a traveler who, feeling parched, suddenly needs to find water and starts digging a well without preparing in advance. This scenario teaches us that we should plan ahead and not wait until the last moment to take action.

## Examples

- 他总是临渴掘井，从不提前准备。<br>He always waits until the last minute to prepare, never planning ahead.
- 临渴掘井的后果很严重。<br>The consequences of acting too late can be serious.
