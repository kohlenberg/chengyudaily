There was once an old man living near a border who lost his horse. His neighbors lamented his loss, but he simply said, "Maybe it's a good thing." Later, the horse returned with another horse, and the neighbors congratulated him. But the old man replied, "Maybe it's not a good thing." Soon after, his son fell from the new horse and broke his leg. While everyone was concerned, he again said, "Maybe it's a good thing."
