Welcome to Chengyu Bites — your quick summary on Chinese 成语. Today, we're exploring a fun idiom about communication and understanding. The phrase is: 对牛弹琴, duì niú tán qín. 对 (duì) - to face, to confront 牛 (niú) - cow 弹 (tán) - to play (a stringed instrument) 琴 (qín) - lute, musical instrument So, the full idiom is 对牛弹琴, which literally means 'playing the lute to a cow.' Figuratively, it means talking to someone who doesn't understand or appreciate what you're saying. Here’s the story behind it: In ancient China, there was a talented musician who loved to play beautiful melodies. One day, he decided to play for a cow, thinking the animal would enjoy the music. However, the cow just stood there, chewing grass, completely uninterested. The musician realized that his wonderful music was wasted on someone who couldn't appreciate it. This story teaches us that sometimes, our efforts to communicate may not reach those who are unable to understand. Example 1: 你跟他讲这些道理就像对牛弹琴。  
Talking to him about these principles is like playing the lute to a cow. Example 2: 她总是给不喜欢音乐的人推荐歌曲，真是对牛弹琴。
