## Origin
A long time ago, there was a group of people who were having a contest to see who could draw the best snake. One participant finished quickly and added feet to his drawing, thinking it would make it better. However, the judges deemed his drawing flawed, as snakes don’t have feet. This teaches us that sometimes, less is more.
