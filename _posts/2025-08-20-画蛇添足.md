Welcome to Chengyu Bites — your quick summary on Chinese 成语. Today, we're exploring a phrase that warns us against overcomplicating things.  The phrase is: 画蛇添足, huà shé tiān zú.  画 (huà) means 'to draw'  蛇 (shé) means 'snake'  添 (tiān) means 'to add'  足 (zú) means 'feet'  So, the full idiom again is 画蛇添足, which literally means 'to draw a snake and add feet.' Figuratively, it means to add unnecessary details or to overdo something.  Here’s the story behind it:  A long time ago, there was a group of people who were having a contest to see who could draw the best snake. One participant finished quickly and added feet to his drawing, thinking it would make it better. However, the judges deemed his drawing flawed, as snakes don’t have feet. This teaches us that sometimes, less is more.  Example one: 他做的工作很出色，不需要画蛇添足。  His work is excellent; it doesn’t need any unnecessary details.  Example two: 在演讲中，尽量避免画蛇添足。  In a speech, try to avoid overcomplicating things.  Example three: 这篇文章已经很好，不需要再画蛇添足。  This article is already good; no need to add unnecessary details.  So, we have 画蛇添足, which means to add unnecessary details. Thank you for joining me today! Thanks for listening to Chengyu Bites! See you next time for another idiom.
