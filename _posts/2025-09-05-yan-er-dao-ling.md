> Today, we explore a phrase that highlights the futility of self-deception.

## Overview
Covering one's ears while stealing a bell; ignoring a problem doesn't solve it.

## Phrase
**掩耳盗铃** — yǎn ěr dào líng
## Characters


掩 (yǎn) — to cover  
耳 (ěr) — ear  
盗 (dào) — to steal  
铃 (líng) — bell


## Origin
A long time ago, a man wanted to steal a bell but knew it would make a loud noise. To avoid getting caught, he covered his ears, thinking that if he couldn't hear it, he wouldn't be discovered. However, this silly tactic only made it easier for others to catch him.

## Examples
- 他掩耳盗铃，不愿面对自己的错误。<br>He is covering his ears while stealing the bell, unwilling to face his mistakes.
- 她选择掩耳盗铃，不想听到别人对她的批评。<br>She chooses to cover her ears while stealing the bell, not wanting to hear others' criticisms of her.
- 这种行为就像掩耳盗铃，根本没有解决问题。<br>This behavior is just like covering one's ears while stealing a bell; it doesn't solve the problem at all.

## Closing
掩耳盗铃 means to ignore a problem, thinking it will go away.
