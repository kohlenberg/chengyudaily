Welcome to Chengyu Bites — your quick summary on Chinese 成语. Today, we explore a phrase that describes being in a precarious situation.  The phrase is: 千钧一发, qiān jūn yī fà.  千 (qiān) means 'thousand'  钧 (jūn) means 'pound'  一 (yī) means 'one'  发 (fà) means 'hair'  Full idiom again: 千钧一发 (A thousand pounds hanging by a hair); it figuratively refers to being in a critical or dangerous situation.  Here’s the story behind it:  This idiom originates from ancient China, where a 'jūn' is a unit of weight. Imagine a heavy weight, like a thousand pounds, delicately balanced on a single hair. If that hair snaps, the weight falls, signifying the precariousness of the situation. Over time, this expression evolved into a metaphor for moments where everything hangs in the balance.  Example one: 这次考试对她来说真是千钧一发。  This exam is truly a critical moment for her.  Example two: 他们的决定像千钧一发，必须小心。  Their decision is like a thousand pounds hanging by a hair; they must be careful.  Example three: 在比赛的最后几秒，比分平局，情况千钧一发。  In the last few seconds of the game, with the score tied, the situation is critical.  So, that’s 千钧一发, which means a critical moment.
